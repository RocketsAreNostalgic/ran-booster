# Contributing

Use a Conventional Commit pull-request title (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`) so the squash commit subject consumed by Release Please truthfully represents the change.

Before proposing a change, install the locked Composer and pnpm dependencies, then run:

```sh
composer check
pnpm check
```

`composer check` is the ordinary non-mutating PHP aggregate. It retains localisation/generated-state checks, deterministic tests, Admin Shell verification, the independent `lint:syntax` parser sweep, `standards` (PHPCS/WPCS/PHPCompatibility), and the existing blocking `analyze` contract. `composer standards:fix` is the matching mutating PHPCBF command and is not part of the required check.

Runtime, archive, release-candidate, and WordPress lifecycle changes need the focused proof required by [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Do not commit generated release ZIPs, secret sidecars, WordPress runtime state, or credentials.

Release Please owns version/changelog/release-PR/tag/draft lifecycle. The pinned shared Profile B workflow promotes only the exact ZIP and checksum emitted by successful main Quality; do not add repository-local candidate markers, publisher state, mutable release recovery, or a second version engine.

Follow [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for ordinary support, non-sensitive defects, and feature requests. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerabilities; do not submit security details in an issue or pull request.

RAN Booster is distributed through verified GitHub release artifacts rather than WordPress.org. Do not add WordPress.org/SVN publication, a hosted licence service, telemetry, or a second update authority without a separate decision.
